6. Questions for consideration
1. Wh\ do Ze Yalidate data before sending it to the serYer at client-side, as opposed to just letting
the serYer Yalidate data before using it? What Ze get and Zhat Ze lose b\ it?

Gain: less load on server Lose: Validation can be surpassed

2. HoZ secure is the s\stem using an access token to authenticate? Is there an\ Za\ to circumYent it
and get access to priYate data?

All server functions returning data requires a token.
Not any way circumvent that we have noticed.    

3. What Zould happen if a user Zere to post a message containing JaYaScript-code? Would the code
be e[ecuted? HoZ can it oppose a threat to the s\stem? What Zould the counter measure?

We tried posting a script in the message form, but it is not executed.
A script could possibly access local storage and send the access token to a third party.

Possible protection: strip all input of forbidden characters or keywords.

4. What happens Zhen Ze use the back/forZard buttons Zhile Zorking Zith TZidder? Is this the
e[pected behaYiour? Wh\ are Ze getting this behaYiour? What Zould be the solution?

Because it is a single page application it should not pe possible to go forward/backwards.

5. What happens Zhen the user refreshes the page Zhile Zorking Zith TZidder? Is this the e[pected
behaYiour? Wh\ are Ze getting this behaYiour?

We get the expected behaviour. The onload function restores the content from data in local storage.

6. Is it a good idea to read YieZs from the serYer instead of embedding them inside of the
³client.html´? What are the adYantages and disadYantages of it comparing to the current
approach?

current approach: More data loaded at once, user could change to a different view by manipulating cookies or executing scripts.

7. Is it a good idea to return true or false to state if an operation has gone Zrong at the serYer-side or
not? HoZ can it be improYed?

Could be improved with specific status codes to indicate what went wrong. Status codes is easier to translate directly to specific error messages.

8. Is it reliable to perform data Yalidation at client-side? If so please e[plain hoZ and if not Zhat
Zould be the solution to improYe it?

It is good for trivial validation, like length of passwords or required fields.
But server should still validate to prevent sql injections or script injections.


9. Wh\ isn¶t it a good idea to use WDEOHV for la\out purposes? What Zould be the replacement?

Tables look bad yeah. Grids/flexboxes etc are good replacements.

10. HoZ do \ou think Single Page Applications can contribute to the future of the Zeb? What is their
adYantages and disadYantages from usage and deYelopment point of YieZs?

Better user experience. Faster feeling, no reloads or redirects to other pages. 

Multipage devloping offers more separation of code and modularity which is easier to maintain.
